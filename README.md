### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with seven years of experience across different areas of IT and software development. My journey started with hands-on technical support, moved through software testing and documentation, and eventually led to software design and management. Throughout, Iâ€™ve developed a knack for problem-solving and critical thinking, especially when tackling new challenges.

I decided to deepen my skills by completing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, giving me hands-on experience in full-stack development, and Iâ€™m excited to use everything Iâ€™ve learned to create innovative and practical solutions as a software engineer.

StoreBytes is a file storage and management system inspired by AWS S3. I created this project to host the files and images required by my applications, in order to avoid any unexpected costs associated with using S3 storage.

It enables users to securely upload, retrieve, and manage files via an API. Public URLs are provided for seamless file sharing and integration into websites and applications.
