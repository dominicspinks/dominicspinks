### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with seven years of experience across different areas of IT and software development. My journey started with hands-on technical support, moved through software testing and documentation, and eventually led to software design and management. Throughout, Iâ€™ve developed a knack for problem-solving and critical thinking, especially when tackling new challenges.

I decided to deepen my skills by completing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, giving me hands-on experience in full-stack development, and Iâ€™m excited to use everything Iâ€™ve learned to create innovative and practical solutions as a software engineer.

# Projects

## [Portfolio](https://github.com/dominicspinks/dominic-portfolio)

### React | TypeScript

This portfolio showcases my work, skills, and projects in software development. Built with React, it features a clean and responsive design to highlight my journey and accomplishments, including detailed project sections, an about me page, and contact information.

## [Life](https://github.com/dominicspinks/life)

### Angular | TypeScript | Python | Django REST Framework | PostgreSQL

Life App is a personal dashboard for managing modular tools that help organise your digital life. This app was created to replace the numerous google sheets I was using for my life admin.

The key feature is the budget tool, which allows you to record your income and expenses and stay on track with your budget. It also features a customisable list module, allowing you to create lists of any content you need.

The front end is built using Angular and TypeScript, and the API is powered by Django REST Framework and PostgreSQL.

## [RepRealm](https://github.com/dominicspinks/RepRealm)

### React Native | Node.js | NestJS | PostgreSQL | Prisma | Drizzle ORM | SQLite

RepRealm is a fitness app for creating and tracking workouts. I developed this application to help users create custom exercises and routines to track their progress and manage their workouts effectively.

It enables users to build personalised exercise libraries, design workout routines, and monitor their fitness journey through an intuitive mobile interface.

The app features a React Native mobile frontend with Drizzle ORM and SQLite for local database management, paired with a Node.js and NestJS backend using PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM.

## [StoreBytes](https://github.com/dominicspinks/StoreBytes)

### C# | Razor Pages | .NET 8 | PostgreSQL | Dapper

StoreBytes is a file storage and management system inspired by AWS S3. I created this project to host the files and images required by my applications, in order to avoid any unexpected costs associated with using S3 storage.

It enables users to securely upload, retrieve, and manage files via an API. Public URLs are provided for seamless file sharing and integration into websites and applications.

It features a .NET 8 API with a PostgreSQL database, and a front-end built with Razor pages.

## [ProjectPacer](https://github.com/dominicspinks/ProjectPacer)

### React | JavaScript | Supabase

This is my capstone project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. It uses React (JavaScript) for the front-end and a serverless backend powered by Supabase.

ProjectPacer is a project management application designed to help small teams efficiently manage their projects. It provides features for user authentication, tracking project progress, and facilitating team communication through the included chat widget.

## [TripMixer](https://github.com/dominicspinks/tripmixer)

### Python | Django | PostgreSQL

TripMixer is a travel planning app designed to help users create and manage their holiday. Users can plan their trips, select their preferred destinations, and customize their itinerary to suit their preferences.

Users can also share their trips and experiences with other users, allowing them to get inspired and connect with other travellers.

TripMixer has been updated to support my StoreBytes file storage and management system.

## Deployment & Self-Hosting

### Docker | Portainer | Linux | Nginx | Let's Encrypt

I deploy and host all my applications on my own Virtual Private Server (VPS) running Ubuntu Linux. This self-hosted approach gives me complete control over my infrastructure while providing valuable experience in DevOps practices.

My deployment workflow leverages Docker containers orchestrated through Portainer for simplified management. Each application runs in its own containerised environment with appropriate networking and volume configurations to ensure isolation and security.

For web services, I use Nginx as a reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections. This setup allows me to host multiple applications on a single server while maintaining separate domains and subdomains.

This hands-on experience with Linux server administration, containerisation technologies, and deployment pipelines has strengthened my full-stack capabilities beyond development alone.
