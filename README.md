### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a six-year journey through the diverse realms of IT and software development. Starting from hands-on technical support, progressing through software testing and documentation, and advancing into software design and management, I've consistently adapted to deliver solutions. My core strength lies in problem-solving and critical thinking, thriving on intellectually challenging work that involves solving novel problems.

While my current role encompasses designing software, my ambition extends to contributing to the entire development process. This aspiration prompted my enrollment in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, marking my commitment to become a software engineer. Looking forward, I am poised to leverage this background, coupled with my newfound skills, to make impactful strides in software engineering.
